# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

A weather dashboard app that allows you to search for, and view weather for multiple cities and states. 

This project was designed to help test my skills and abilities utilizing external APIs. For this project I used openWeather API to request and render the data in the browser. 
I was responsible for creating the backend, connecting it to the front end, and deploying the site.
